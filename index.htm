<h1>It Depends.</h1>
<div class="subhead">Seriously, though, there are pros and cons. There is no right answer for everyone.</div>


<div class="content">
<p class="section">Pros:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You walk away with a great understanding of C and C++.</li>
	<li>The knowledge gained from EECS 381 prepares you for many interview questions.</li>
	<li>It turns you into a good programmer.</li>
	<li>&quot;The only people who donâ€™t benefit from 381 are people who are exceptionally good programmers to begin with, or have already been programming for a very long time.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;In regards to how this class will help you beyond college:
		<ol>
			<li>You will have mastery over pointers.</li>
			<li>You will begin to understand how to write code that is easy to debug and change.</li>
			<li>You will be introduced to design patterns.</li>
			<li>You will begin to understand Object Oriented programming.&quot;</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>You will leave the class knowing the STL forwards and backwards.</li>
</ol>

<p class="section">Cons:</p>

<ol>
<li>You spend a huge amount of time and effort on the class&mdash;effort that could be best spent on other classes, activities, or simply on life.
	<ul>
		<li>A significant amount of time is spent on iterating your code style and design to satisfy Prof. Kieras's preferences rather than actually doing something useful.</li>
		<li>You can pick up design patterns yourself and can gain intimate familiarity with C++ just by trying to understand compiler errors.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>OO design can be learned <i>in situ</i> and you'll have extra time to do whatever (see #1).</li>
<li>&quot;Many students are there for the prestige and not the content.&quot;</li>
<li>The overwhelming focus on C++ in EECS 381 creates an environment where it's easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees.</li>
<li>&quot;Spending the semester working on a such project, such as an app you ship to the store, instead of drowning in the absurd course load, seems like a 1000x increase in benefit for a student's future.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It's boring.&quot;</li>
</ol>
